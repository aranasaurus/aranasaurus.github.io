        <div class="excerpt">Work has been pretty busy this week so my off-time has been spent reading more than coding.
And now that I&#8217;ve decided that I&#8217;ll be making my own &#8220;engine&#8221; and using C or C++ for a large
portion of it, my next task is to decide between C and C++.

        <div class="excerpt">After just a few days of the game a week challenge I realized that I&#8217;m not ready to start that yet. Not if I want
to succeed at it anyway, and not if I want to use my own engine as opposed to Unity or something similar.

        <div class="excerpt">Today I did more in-depth reading about the Lua-C interoperability and some coding, trying things out. My thoughts from day 2 still stand. Next up
will be making sure I can get that stuff working in my iOS project and then actually getting started on the C++ parts of the engine.

        <div class="excerpt">Today I wanted to get it figured out where the line will be drawn as to which logic is written in C/C++ and what
gets done in Lua.

because I&#8217;d need to get a few pre-requisite things done:

			<h1><a href="/2014/10/23/game-dev-week/">Game Dev Week</a></h1>
		

        <div class="excerpt">By day I’m a mobile developer working for <a href="http://www.esri.com">Esri</a> at their <a href="http://pdx.esri.com">Portland R&amp;D Center</a>.
By night (and weekend), when not playing with my kids, I really enjoy making games, though. So recently I took a week off
from the day job to work on a game idea I’ve been rolling around for quite some time (while the kids are at school). I had
a prototype working but I wanted to give it my full attention for a week and see where I could get it in that time. I’ll
talk more about the details of the game in other posts, this one is more about the experience of said “Game Dev Week”.
