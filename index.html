			<h1><a href="/2014/11/08/testability/">Testability</a></h1>
		

        <div class="excerpt">I&#8217;ve been working on a project at work for the past few months that started with a basic idea of what was
required of it, and then after a series of proof-of-concept demos we now have a better idea of what this
thing needs to do, and more importantly <em>how</em> it needs to do it. This type of organic development process
is great, but it can have some side effects for the code base. Primarily there are some code paths that
made it into the code base to support some functionality that is no longer required, as well as some
implementations allowing for requirements that have either gone away or changed, leaving some strange
looking implementation artifacts. Secondarily we did not have time to write tests and setup CI and all
those other best practice and stability things. I spent most of my week addressing these two things.

        <div class="excerpt">Work has been pretty busy this week so my off-time has been spent reading more than coding.
And now that I&#8217;ve decided that I&#8217;ll be making my own &#8220;engine&#8221; and using C or C++ for a large
portion of it, my next task is to decide between C and C++.

        <div class="excerpt">After just a few days of the game a week challenge I realized that I&#8217;m not ready to start that yet. Not if I want
to succeed at it anyway, and not if I want to use my own engine as opposed to Unity or something similar.

gets done in Lua.

			<h1><a href="/2014/10/23/game-dev-week/">Game Dev Week</a></h1>
		

        <div class="excerpt">By day I’m a mobile developer working for <a href="http://www.esri.com">Esri</a> at their <a href="http://pdx.esri.com">Portland R&amp;D Center</a>.
By night (and weekend), when not playing with my kids, I really enjoy making games, though. So recently I took a week off
from the day job to work on a game idea I’ve been rolling around for quite some time (while the kids are at school). I had
a prototype working but I wanted to give it my full attention for a week and see where I could get it in that time. I’ll
talk more about the details of the game in other posts, this one is more about the experience of said “Game Dev Week”.
