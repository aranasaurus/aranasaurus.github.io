        <div class="excerpt">Have you ever noticed how the ghosts in Pac-Man don&#8217;t all chase him in the same fashion? Does that kind of thing
pique your interest?  Well, it does mine! So I built a thing that visualizes their AI strategies and that&#8217;s what
this post is going to be all about.

			<h1><a href="/2014/12/23/ld31/">LD31</a></h1>
		

        <div class="excerpt">Earlier this month I (partially) participated in <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/2014/12/03/welcome-to-ludum-dare-31/" title="LD31">Ludum Dare 31</a>. I say partially, because I had a lot of family stuff going on that was
going to take up most of my weekend, as I <a href="https://twitter.com/aranasaurus/status/540945881021677568" title="Twitter">tweeted</a> earlier in the week. But on Friday night after putting the kids to sleep I
checked the theme and saw that it was one of the ones I had actively voted <em>against</em>: “Entire game on one screen”. So I was like, “Well, I guess
it’s for the better; I didn’t want that theme anyway, so this’ll make it easier for me to ignore the compo/jam.” But then ideas started pouring
into my head and some of them seemed like they were pretty good, too! I sat there, unable to sleep as I rolled these ideas through the tumbler
over and over until I landed on an idea that not only sounded good, but I had a pretty good handle on <em>how</em> to do it and it <em>might</em> even be able
to be completed in the &lt; 24 hours I’d be able to commit to the jam.

			<h1><a href="/2014/11/08/testability/">Testability</a></h1>
		

        <div class="excerpt">I&#8217;ve been working on a project at work for the past few months that started with a basic idea of what was
required of it, and then after a series of proof-of-concept demos we now have a better idea of what this
thing needs to do, and more importantly <em>how</em> it needs to do it. This type of organic development process
is great, but it can have some side effects for the code base. Primarily there are some code paths that
made it into the code base to support some functionality that is no longer required, as well as some
implementations allowing for requirements that have either gone away or changed, leaving some strange
looking implementation artifacts. Secondarily we did not have time to write tests and setup CI and all
those other best practice and stability things. I spent most of my week addressing these two things.

        <div class="excerpt">Work has been pretty busy this week so my off-time has been spent reading more than coding.
And now that I&#8217;ve decided that I&#8217;ll be making my own &#8220;engine&#8221; and using C or C++ for a large
portion of it, my next task is to decide between C and C++.

to succeed at it anyway, and not if I want to use my own engine as opposed to Unity or something similar.

			<h1><a href="/2014/10/23/game-dev-week/">Game Dev Week</a></h1>
		

        <div class="excerpt">By day I’m a mobile developer working for <a href="http://www.esri.com">Esri</a> at their <a href="http://pdx.esri.com">Portland R&amp;D Center</a>.
By night (and weekend), when not playing with my kids, I really enjoy making games, though. So recently I took a week off
from the day job to work on a game idea I’ve been rolling around for quite some time (while the kids are at school). I had
a prototype working but I wanted to give it my full attention for a week and see where I could get it in that time. I’ll
talk more about the details of the game in other posts, this one is more about the experience of said “Game Dev Week”.
