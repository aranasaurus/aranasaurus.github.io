          <p>Getting started on this week’s game on Friday night… The first week was already going to be a little funky
because I’d need to get a few pre-requisite things done:</p>

<!-- more -->

<ul>
  <li>Decide on a framework and language</li>
  <li>Get <strong>an</strong> app built with said framework and language</li>
  <li>Try to templatize that app a little to make starting fresh each week easier</li>
</ul>

<p>The first few weeks are going to have a lot more engine development than later weeks as well, since I will
be starting from scratch (aside from what <a href="http://libsdl.org" title="SDL2">SDL</a> gives me, that is) in that regard. So I’m thinking the
first week is actually going to end up being 1.5 weeks.</p>

<p>Tonight (and well into the wee hours of the morning) I did a bit of research and eliminated the <a href="http://golang.org" title="Go">go-lang</a> option
as it still can’t be built to iOS as far as I can tell. I’ve settled on SDL for sure, and got a templatizable
Xcode project started which is building to the Simulator. I found <a href="http://www.ciaranmccormack.com/sdl-2-0-on-ios-using-xcode-opengl-es-2-0-and-c-11/" title="SDL 2 on iOS - Ciaran McCormack">this video</a> quite helpful
in that endeavor. I started a <a href="http://github.com/aranasaurus/game-a-week">github repo</a> for the whole
challenge and put tonight’s progress in there.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I’ll need to do a bit more reading about doing Lua bindings, and experiment a bit with that and think
about how/if I want to design the engine with respect to that. I’d really much rather be writing game logic
in Lua than C++ for a myriad of reasons not the least of which being that Lua is just so much easier to write
quickly. Engine work will probably still be in C++ (or even C, for that matter), but I want to spend time really
thinking about the separation of concerns and where it makes sense to do the binding between the two.</p>
