After just a few days of the game a week challenge I realized that I'm not ready to start that yet. Not if I want
to succeed at it anyway, and not if I want to use my own engine as opposed to Unity or something similar.

<!-- more -->

I still think the process I was going through of documenting my thought process and progress was helpful and
I'm going to continue to do that while I make my engine and use it to make those first few simple clones
that I was going to do for the Game a Week challenge.

In other words, I'm not gonna do Game a Week for a few more weeks, but I _am_ gonna keep posting stuff here
similar to my first few Game a Week posts. I'll probably go back and edit those posts a little too and structure
them as generic development posts as opposed to Game a Week journal entries. You know... for posterity.
