This past weekend I (partially) participated in [Ludum Dare 31](LD31). I say partially, because I had a lot of family stuff going on that was
going to take up most of my weekend. I even [tweeted](no-LD31-for-me) about my sorrows. But on Friday night after putting the kids to sleep I
checked the theme and saw that it was one of the ones I had actively voted *against*: "Entire game on one screen". So I was like, "Well, I guess
it's for the better; I didn't want that theme anyway, so this'll make it easier for me to ignore the compo/jam." But then ideas started pouring
into my head and some of them seemed like they were pretty good, too! I sat there, unable to sleep as I rolled these ideas through the tumbler
over and over until I landed on an idea that not only sounded good, but I had a pretty good handle on how to do it and it *might* even be able
to be completed in the < 24 hours I'd have to participate in the jam.
